# Viper
Offers talon voice customization for hissing control.

Viper provides a hissing menu that opens by default when you hiss. The selected item on the menu advances as you keep hissing, and you choose the currently selected item and close the menu by stopping hissing. The default main menu is primarily geared towards mouse control.

Be aware that excessive use of hissing can harm your jaw. Also, using the direction changed graphical display while set to rotate rapidly may harm users susceptible to seizures triggered by visual stimulus.

## Pick Direction and Move
This menu option shows a line at the cursor pointing in the movement direction. Hissing from here will rotate the line until you stop. Hissing after that will then move the cursor in the desired direction. This offers a slow but sometimes useful way to move the cursor.

## Scroll
This opens a submenu for picking a scroll direction. Hissing after picking a direction will scroll in that direction. 

## Keyboard
This opens an experimental set of menus for operating the keyboard. This is a highly inefficient way to operate the keyboard. 

## Credit
The display code for the direction line was heavily based on the knausj_talon configuration. Proper credit and a copy of the knausj_talon license is available in the direction_display.py file.
